# Level 23-24

- uh-oh this one requires me to write my first shell-script
    - let's see how this goes...
- I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this one without any external help.

- ill try to only see the bare minimum from the tutorial, or at the very least take some good notes, here goes:
    - a basic bash script loop looks something like this:
        ~~~
        for f in file1 file2 file3 
        do
            echo "Processing $f"
            # Do something with $f
        done
        ~~~

- that might be the only info I need lol, let's go back on our own here:    
    - so that means that the loop inside bandit24.sh:
        - is iterating over the current directory " ." 
    - I think this line "if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];":
        - is just error handling, making sure its not the literal '.' or '..'
    - then it prints "Handling $i"
    - then it calls to stat
        - "stat - display file or file system status" 
        - it really just the whole 'ls' command printed out 
        - adding the "--format "%U" just pulls the user owner from the 'ls' stat command
        - the result of value, at the index '$i' is stored in value owner
        - basically checking to see if the owner is 'bandit23' (us currently)
        - its starting to look like I should check the permissions of the script
            - turns out the file is owned by bandit24 (makes sense)
            - but the group owner is bandit23
        - if the owner is bandit23 (us) then the file does a timeout
        - else it deletes the file 
    - lets try to decipher some stuff:
        - this script is run every minute, of every hour, of every day
            - based on the * * * * * in the crontab
        - I'm having a hard time trying to understand the goal here
            - there's a file that runs a scripts
            - but there's also /var/spool/bandit24
            - how are all of these connected?
        - is it to stop this script from deleting everything inside the folder?

- alright time to go back to the tutorial
    - so I'm following everything that they outline about the script
        - I got everything right onpar
    - the gist of the goal is this:
        - whatever file is inside 'bandit24' folder gets executed, and if the file was created by bandit23, then its deleted (after 60s)
        - if we want the password for bandit24 we to write a script that will be executed from the bandit24 folder
            - is this some sort of setuid folder? (it was highlighted oddly)
    - were starting to create a new script
        - reading the contents of /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 into /tmp/xxx/password (a file I created)
    - gotta change the permissions to everyone for our temp folder
        - so its not owned by any one user/bandit
    - then were gonna copy our script into the /var/spool/bandit24 folder
        - I probably woulda never thought of that, since we dont have permissions to access it
        - BUT I have to remember that just cause I can't 'cd' into the folder does not mean that I can't copy things into it
    - and bingo! once the script runs inside cron, then it copies the password into our 'password' file

- WOW, that was much more about permissions that it was about scripting
    - just goes to show how much you have to know to be able to properly interact with the system,
    - permissions are something that I need to master more
