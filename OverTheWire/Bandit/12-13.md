# Level 12-13

- so working with a compressed file that has a different extension
    - how can find out which compression algorithm its using?
    - stack overflow page brought me to a list of file signatures on wiki
    - used 'head data.txt' to see what the first couple hex chars were
        - it was '1F 8B' 
        - did a CTRL-F on the page and found it was a 'gzip compressed file' 

- getting some errors when trying to decompress, obviously doing this wrong
    - time to read about hexdumps on wiki
    - still seems like doing a hexdump just reads out the info, not sure if I need to convert something or not
- ok just decided to read a walkthrough
    - turns out I can output the hexdump to another file
        - 'xxd -r data.txt data'
        - now run 'file data' and get a gzip compressed file
    - mv it into a .gz file
    - it outputs a bz2 file
        - do the same thing over again
    - outputs another .gz
    - outputs a tarball
        - are we finally there?
        - another tar ball?!
    - another bzip2
    - another tarball
    - another gzip
    - finally were there....

- lessons learned:
    - follow your gut with that wanting to ouput to a file
