# Level 20-21

- Ok so this is some connection monitoring stuff
- recommended commands includes screen/tmux and 'job control' with a highlight of CTRL-Z
    - thats my hint to just not execute this command inside the main terminal prompt
    - let me open that bad boy up with screen
- did a local nmap scan
    - found that the port we want to connect to is 30000
    - or else ./suconncet says that it failed to connect
    - but now we only get a blank prompt
    - I tried opening up two screens and running the processes in both
    - inputted the passwords into both screens, and got nothing
- do I need to listen on netcat?
    - nah nothing with netcat yet, even on the '-l' listen mode
- ok so I ended up having to use a tutorial for this one
    - I had the concept backwards
    - I needed to setup netcat to run (continuously with &) on any port, didnt need to be 30000
        - 'echo "<previous_password>' | netcat -lp 1234' 
    - once it was listening for that then I could go to my other 'screen' instance 
    - from there I just executed it with the proper port
    - and bingo! it spat out the proper code
    - still trying to figure out why that happened the way it did
        - netcat said it couldnt bind on the port 30000, maybe because it was already in use? 
        - you know, in the description it says that the setuid binary just takes a port and reads from any incoming connection. So I guess that is the lesson to be learned here: netcat is good at sending AND receiving data. Its important to read the descriptions super carefully.
