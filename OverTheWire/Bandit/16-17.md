# Level 16-17

- looks like im going to have to reference some nmap material from @THM
    - 'nmap -p 31000-32000 locahost' 
    - renders the 5 open ports between that range 
        - 31046, 31518, 31691, 31790, 31960
    - now I gotta figure out which one is SSL
        - should I just run it with more verbosity?
    - running 'nmap -A' on each port:
        - 31046: just 'echo'
        - 31518: this one seems to have SSL, lets continue just in case
        - 31691: just another echo
        - 31790: oh, this one is SSL but seems to be asking for a password!
        - 31960: juts another echo
    - looks like I know where I have to look further
        - same connection method as before:
            - 'openssl s_client --connect localhost:31790'
            - get that blank input
            - input last password
            - I got back an RSA key
            - looks like I gotta login with that, and acquire the password from /etc/ like in that previous challengeS
        - have to go through the process of creating a temp folder in /tmp
        - create a private key file
        - ssh in
            - argh adjust setting to make them 400, got told the permissions were too open for a private key
        - and were in
            - time to go get the password
