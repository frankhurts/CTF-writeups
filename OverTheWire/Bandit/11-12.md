# Level 11-12

- ok this is a Rot13 thing
    - basically a ceasar cipher
    - changes the position of the letter in the alphabet exactly to its inverse
        - 13 characters over
    - time to do some research on how to get rid of this on linux
        - I guess its going to be with the xxd command (hexdump)
        - maybe with the tr command? (translate or delete characters)
        - some StackOverflow page states this command:
            - tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
            - which seems to state a switch between a-z letters (upper and lower) with their +13 equivalents (N)
            - lets test it I guess, and see if it works?
            - then well do more research to understand that exactly after
    - ok that worked, now lets try to understand the process here:
        - so the initial command is this tr "'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'"
        - the basic command being "tr [set1] [set2]"
            - converting one set into the other
        - what were doing is:
            - " tr '[a-z][A-Z]' '[n-za-m][N-ZA-M]'
            - which gibes us the condensed version after
            - makes more sense this, its seperating based on upper/lower case and then converting to the new sequence of lettering (indexing properly)
