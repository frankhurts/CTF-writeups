# Level 22-23

- found the bash script that its supposed to run on crontab
- its just doing some funny stuff, gotta follow the rabbit to find what the proper file name is going to be, once stored in /tmp/
    - gonna go through it step by step
    - basically just need to know what $mytarget is
        - maybe I can access the file from there?
        - cause it seems I dont have permission to cat the file
    - yeah I just cat'ed the tmp file and got the password, bingo!
