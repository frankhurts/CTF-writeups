# Level 13-14 

- this one involves ssh keys
    - this is one subject that I have not researched much
    - and a subject that the little research I have conducted has not truly stuck with me
- sadly I think this might be a level that I need to follow a walkthrough
- trying to login before following tutorial
    - using the '-i' flag to point to the bandit14 file wont work
- ok I just went back to the home menu and realised there was a private key file
    - i used that file with the '-i' flag and it worked
    - that was misleading to say to go look in the /etc/ directory...
- after confirming with the tutorial
    - the point of the /etc/ hint is to go check the password AFTER you have lgoged in
    - makes sense...
