# Level 28-29

- just another git repo clone 
- this README seems to be making a joke?

    # Bandit Notes
    Some notes for level29 of bandit.

    ## credentials

    - username: bandit29
    - password: xxxxxxxxxx

- is this some sort of call to /etc/password
    - imagine if it was just literal
    - definitely not literal
- ill take a look inside the .git folder
    - can't really seem to find anything in there

- tutorial time:
    - duh, were gonna go through past commits
    - idk why I went looking for previous files inside the .git when the commits OBVIOUSLY exist as part of the files themselves
    - use 'git log' command to see past commits
    - this is definitely git commands I have never used before
        - 'git checkout edd935d60906b33f0619605abd1689808ccdd5ee' which is the latest commit named 'fix info leak', def sus
    - I even tried to cat the README thinking it had updated the file itself
        - NOPE, I need to 'git show' to display the diff between the current file and the commit I just checked out
    - this is the easiest way to see the diffs between all files
        - there only happens to be one file in this instance
    - bingo there's the password
