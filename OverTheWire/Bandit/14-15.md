- I knew off the bat that this would require some sort of listening to a port while I send the message over
    - so I did some research
    - found out that netcat is used to open a channel
    - just using netcat -l -p <port> wasnt good enough 
        - that was just listening on the port
    - we needed to send a message right off the hop and then listen for the answer
    - so thus came the answer:
        - 'echo 4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e | netcat localhost 30000'
