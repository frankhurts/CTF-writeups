# Level 30-31

- another git repo problem
- this time the file is empty
    - any hidden files? nope. 
- Lets check commits and branches
    - only 1 commit: initial commit
    - only 1 branch: initial commit 

- from here I'm not really where to go, let's see the tutorial for any hints
    - let's take a look at the 'git tag' command
    - it returns the word 'secret'
    - what if I just do 'git show secret' 
    - bingo! 
- tagging is just used to mark important locations inside a Version Control System
    - e.g.: V1.0, V2.0, stuff like that
