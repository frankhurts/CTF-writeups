# Level 9

- so I think I found it, not in the best way tho
    - tried originally using 'uniq -u data.txt'
    - this printed all the lines, without their dups, but still all of them
        - so couldnt actually get a tell on whether they were unique or not
    - so then I tried using 'sort'
        - this helped a lot, and visually I could tell which lines were the same
        - thus I accidentally found the answer: UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR        - but I dont like relying on visual tells
    - so then I piped the sort into uniq
        - 'sort data.txt | uniq -d'
        - which done nothing really
        - so lets see if adding the line counter helps now
        - it prints all the lines (only once) with their counters (all 10)
        - but it doesnt print the answer line with a value of 1!
            - im obviously not using this command proprely, let me do some
              checks
        - im an idiot, I used -d to see the dups
        - just changed it back to 'uniq -u' and got the answer
