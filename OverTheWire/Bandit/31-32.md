# Level 31-32

- same setup as last time, git repo
- this readme says:
    ~~~
    This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

    Details:
        File name: key.txt
        Content: 'May I come in?'
        Branch: master
    ~~~
- this should be pretty easy for me 
    - seems like adding the file to a commit and pushing it simply isnt working
    - I might just be overseeing something simple
    - OK, so not really an oversight, just "*.txt" was included inside the .gitignore file, which means I have to use the -f flag on the git add to "force" the add
- and there comes the password
