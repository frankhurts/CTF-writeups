# Level 29-30

- starting with another cloning of a repo
- lets do the same routine as last level and see if it yields any results
- README says there is no password in production
    - is that a reference to another branch?
- checked out other branches with 'git show-branch -a'
    - there seems to be other ones
- how do I see what commits are on other branches
    - 'git log origin/dev'
    - git log, git checkout bc833286fca18a3948aec989f7025e23ffc16c07, git show
- bingo there it is!
