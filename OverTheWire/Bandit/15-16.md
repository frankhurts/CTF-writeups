# Level 15-16

- this level start off with the concept as last time, just with SSL
- first lets see what the previous commands yields without SSL
    - just returns '1', probably an error
- can I just use s_client as a replacement for netcat? 
    - seems like I can 'man s_client' but not call to s_client
        - I get a 'command not found' bash error, wtfZZ
    - ok so the command goes 'openssl s_client -connect localhost 30001'
    - but that placed after 'echo <last_password' |' doesnt seem to generate anything
        - we did get a whole bunch of SSL certificate information
    - let's see what running the s_client command alone gives
        - opens the certificate information
        - then just leaves a blank space (as if waiting for input)
        - pasted the last password
        - bingo!
