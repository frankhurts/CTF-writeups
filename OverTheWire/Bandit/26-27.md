# Level 26-27

- so we most definitely have to stay inside the 'more' vim shell
- this one I have no clue how to execute either
    - I could I could see what commands can be prompt related inside more/vim
    - so running more commands inside more/vim doesnt work
        - because everything is being ran inside our /usr/bin/showtext context
    - can we change the shell inside more?
        - 'set shell=/bin/bash'
    - now I try ls command
        - we can see a bandit27-do file
    - cannot execute that file
    - less just shows a binary file
    - 'file bandit27-do' just calls its a dynamically linked .so file

- tutorial time
    - same process, except they spawn a new shell
    - that makes life a lot easier

- turns out you can execute the file, I just didnt do it properly from inside vim
    - returns: "run a command as another user" 
- can I access the password with this?
    - bingo! Just cat'd the password file stored inside /etc/bandit_pass/
