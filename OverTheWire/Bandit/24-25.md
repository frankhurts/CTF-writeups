# Level 24-25

- this is requires some scripting/brute-forcing tactics, as well as networking deamon stuff
    - ouff this will be a good test
- is this when I start cracking open some python/bash scripts?
- before I get into that, can I get any sort of response from the deamon on 30002
    - doing "echo 'UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ' | nc -l -p 30002"
        - does not give anything back
    - solution seems to be simply "nc localhost 30002"
        - this gives us access to a prompt from the service
        - it requests for the password and pin all on one line
    - let's make a simple script with a few lines to see if I can output it to a file
    - something like this:
        ~~~
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ 0000" | nc localhost 30002
        echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ 0001" | nc localhost 30002
        echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ 0002" | nc localhost 30002
        ~~~
    - called like this:
        - './script.sh > output.txt'
    - seems to be a bit messed up, lets try something else
        - tried opening nc up and then echoing the values
        - nope
    - whatever were just gonna mass send a sequence of numbers and then grep "success" or something like that
    - seems like making a sequence of numbers in bash is easy
    - 'seq 1000'
    - updated script:
        ~~~
        #!/bin/bash
        nc localhost 30002

        for i in $(seq 1000)
        do
            echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i" | nc localhost 30002
        done
        ~~~
        - let's see what that gives
    - ok so its going through on every number between 0-1000
    - couple issues though:
        - it's SUPER slow, like (5-10) between each try
        - and its not printing the numbers in a four-digit 'xxxx' format
            - this problem is solvable with some research
        - but im not sure that I want to wait for everything to run through

- Let's see what I can learn from the tutorial
    - identical solution, delivered differently:
    ~~~
    for i in {0000..9999}; do echo “UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i”; done | nc localhost 30002
    ~~~
    - all in one command
    - and my solution to the formatting issue taken care of
    - the only problem is that the program stalls before I get the answer
    - so I dont actually have the solution
    - time to experiment and learn! 

- back to my own studies:
    - maybe I could implement his code into my script?
        - not that it really changes anything, but who knows
    - nah there's not real way of executing it that way inside a script that isnt super slow


- back to another tutorial
    - a file is used to store the totality of the password combinations
    - once thats done:
        - 'cat combinations.txt' | nc localhost 30002 >> output.txt"
    - good, it didnt crash, most likely ran through the whole command
    - it seems, based on this command, that running it all from nc while compiling the 0000..9999 numbers would be too slow, they used telnet
    - so I guess writing the combinations out beforehand helped with that problem
    - checking the results
        - 'sort results.txt | uniq -u'
    - bingo we got the answer
