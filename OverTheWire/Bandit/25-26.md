# Level 25-26

- ok so was able to send a login attempt to bandit26 with the provided RSA private key file 
- but got booted
- hence comes in the shell problem
- where can I check to see what users are using what shells?
    - "cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26"
    ~~~
    bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext
    ~~~
    - so the shell is /usr/bin/showtext?
    - what the hell is that?
        - can I cat it?
        - yes, content are like this:
    ~~~
    #//bin/sh

    export TERM=linux

    more ~/text.txt
    exit 0
    ~~~
    - nothing seems out of the ordinary there
        - I think its the exit 0 that is screwing me

- after looking at tutorial:
    - turns out the more command needs a certain amount of terminal space to run properly
    - we needed to reduce the terminal screen size to less than 6 lines to force 'more' to display only part of the message at a time
        - I would have NEVER known to do that
    - after that we can force 'more' to open another file, vim style
        - DEFINITELY would not have had any idea on how to do that
    - and we can access the '/etc/bandit_pass/bandit26' password file
