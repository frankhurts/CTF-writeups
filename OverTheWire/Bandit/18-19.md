# Level 18-19

- I get booted the moment I try to connect via ssh
- looks like its time to use scp
    - that doesnt seem to be working
- can I do a remote ssh 'ls' command?
    - ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 ls -l /home/bandit18
    - this displays 'readme' as the only file inside the directory
- but for some reason I still cant access it
    - lol, how about I just 'less' or 'cat' the file remotely?
    - yup, bingo!
