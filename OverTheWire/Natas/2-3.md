# Level 2-3

- The message "not even google will find this" should have been my hint
    - I had no idea where that was leading me
    - of course the 'robots.txt' file
    - what does it contain:
        - 'disallow: /s3cr3t/' 
    - ok so now how do I get there if its disallowed?
        - it doesn't actually stop you from accessing it
        - just makes it hidden from SEO
    - there was a 'users.txt' file
